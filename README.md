# Acai-Pwr
Website explaining and detailing the benefits of Acai
Initial Concept
—> Acai Per is a website that was made to provide users with more information about Acai (a Brazilian fruit that grows in the Amazon), the things we can do with it and the benefits of such thing, hoping to get as many people s possible to get to know this amazing fruit. Obviously, it has as target audience everyone that’s looking for a fit life and/or a food to complement their diet and healthy lifestyle, be that after a gym session or in a moral social setting. 
 The website is intended as a static front end application that’s easy to navigate, user friendly and is clear in purpose. In the contact form, users can be redirected to a sign up page where, by providing their details, they can be sent more information on products, recipes, event and gatherings created, hosted and organised by us/our community.

The features I wanted for this website were:
- An easy to navigate nav bar, where users could be easily redirected to what they were looking for.
- A gallery with inspiring recipes, settings and situations where acai could be used, thus providing a healthy to-go snack.
- A contact form so that users could get in touch with our community and receive more information on acai, products, recipes and events.
- Social links in the footer of page for the user to follow the it on different social medias and be up to date with the latest information about the community. 
Future features the website will contain:
- A page detailing different Acai products where users could buy
- A page for a store in Greystones, co. Wicklow
- Testimonials from other users
