        <h3>Acai, the Superfruit?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Acai is a 'berry' (they are theoretically drupes as they have seeds)found in the Amazon, which measures approximatly 2.5cm and have an earthy taste, which at first can be like unsweetened chocolate. After soaked in water and masdhed to form a paste, acai is then sweetened and sold as a frozen fruit puree, pressed juice, or as a dried powder. Its popularity, however, comes from the fact that it has many nutrients and can be extremely beneficial to one's health.</p>
        <p>Being nutrient dense, acai contains calories, calcium, carbs, sugar, fiber, vitamin A, antioxidants and many more minerals, all compacted in a small fruit (a more extensive breakdown of how many nutrients there are in 100g of acai can be found in this <a style="color: white;" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-acai-berries#TOC_TITLE_HDR_3">link</a>).</p>
        <p>It is also believed that acai can boost brain activity, may improve cholesterol levels, and may even be an anti-cancer agent.<p>

        <h3>History of Acai</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Acai was first found and consumed by the indigenous people in South America, and then, by the people inhabiting the most northern parts of Brazil, where the fruit was and still is consumed as a staple, alongside mandioca, with a main course dish</p>
        <p>In the 1970's, the frozen fruit pulp started gaining popularity and being brough over from thre Aamzon to Brazil's northern cities. It wasn't until somewhere in the 80's that Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu founder, Carlos Gracie made the acai bowl popular and brought it over to the southern cities of Brazil, like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and incorporated it in his fighters' diet as a way to maximize their performance.</p>
        <p>A few years later, in the 90's, the fruit became also popular among surfers and fitness enthousiasts, who sought the same benefits and a healthy, nutritious food as those fighters. Not long after, the fruit was also brought over to the US, where it also gained popularity, especially in Hawaii and Southern California, and started being consumed in larger scale.</p>
