        <h3 style="color: white;">Acai, the Superfruit?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Acai is a 'berry' (they are theoretically drupes as they have seeds)found in the Amazon, which measures approximatly 2.5cm and have an earthy taste, which at first can be like unsweetened chocolate. After soaked in water and masdhed to form a paste, acai is then sweetened and sold as a frozen fruit puree, pressed juice, or as a dried powder. Its popularity, however, comes from the fact that it has many nutrients and can be extremely beneficial to one's health.</p>
        <p>Being nutrient dense, acai contains calories, calcium, carbs, sugar, fiber, vitamin A, antioxidants and many more minerals, all compacted in a small fruit (a more extensive breakdown of how many nutrients there are in 100g of acai can be found in this <a style="color: white;" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-acai-berries#TOC_TITLE_HDR_3">link</a>).</p>
        <p>It is also believed that acai can boost brain activity, may improve cholesterol levels, and may even be an anti-cancer agent.<p>

        <h3 style="color: white;">History of Acai</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Acai was first found and consumed by the indigenous people in South America, and then, by the people inhabiting the most northern parts of Brazil, where the fruit was and still is consumed as a staple, alongside mandioca, with a main course dish</p>
        <p>In the 1970's, the frozen fruit pulp started gaining popularity and being brough over from thre Aamzon to Brazil's northern cities. It wasn't until somewhere in the 80's that Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu founder, Carlos Gracie made the acai bowl popular and brought it over to the southern cities of Brazil, like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and incorporated it in his fighters' diet as a way to maximize their performance.</p>
        <p>A few years later, in the 90's, the fruit became also popular among surfers and fitness enthousiasts, who sought the same benefits and a healthy, nutritious food as those fighters. Not long after, the fruit was also brought over to the US, where it also gained popularity, especially in Hawaii and Southern California, and started being consumed in larger scale.</p>

      <h2>Ways you can use it (Recipes)</h2>
        <div class="box1">
          <div>
            <h3 class="para-ways-1">Acai Bowl (Acai na Tigela)</h3>
            <p>
              Probably the most known way acai is consumed, an acai bowl is your go-to recipe when it comes to acai. And the best thing is that your 'acai na itgela' can go as far as your creativity. 
            <br>
              Banana, blueberries, strawberries, granola and kiwi's are a no-brainer, but you don't have to feel limited by that. The secret is to, obviously, find a balance with the fruits,nuts and the other things you put in as toppings. 
            <br>
              Add pretty much what you like and what you feel like eatting and, bum, you can expect a delicious acai bowl, perfect after that intense working out or as that night-out you were planning yesterday.
            </p>

            <h3 class="para-ways-1">Acai Smoothie</h3>
              <p>
                In a rush in the morning and don't have too much time to make that delicious breakfast? Want something quick before going to school/work, or heading to the gym? Don't worry, acai's got you!
                <br>
                Just like with acai bowl, the smoothie version can be/have whatever you want it to. The sky is your limit when it comes to adding things to your smoothie. You can also add pretty much the same things you would to your bowl, with the only difference that the flavours will be all mixed up and blent together, so bare that in mind. 
                <br>
                Another little trick we recommend is adding a little bit of milk or water to your smoothie, to make it more liquid, since acai and the other things can make it really thinck and that can make it almost impossible to drink.

            <h3 class="para-ways-2">Acai Ice Cream</h3>
            <p>
              Done with that meal and feeling like grabbing a dessert, but feeling guilty about overdoing it or going off your diet? Or you feel like you haven't eaten enough but don't want to grab too much, afraid you can;t eat all that? Then an acai ice cream might just be what you're looking for. 
              <br> 
              Even though you'll eat it frozen, you still can add or combine it with whatever want, and it'll still be delicious. 
              <br> 
              Perfect for that extremely hot day or to serve as that healthy dessert to selfishly enjoy alone or with friends at home, an acai ice cream can take your paladar to next level, and will sure make you satisfied without that feeling of guilt for having eaten too much or not eating healthy.

          <div>
            <h3 class="para-ways-2">Savoury Dishes with Acai</h3>
            <p>
              If you think the acai is only something that you can eat as a snack, dessert or a breakfast-thingy, I hate to say it but you're 100% mistaken... 
             <br>
             Where it actually comes from, acai is not a dessert but rather a side dish, or a complement to a main dish. Naturally, acai isn't sweet, but savoury, and that's how it's used by the indigenuous population of the Amazon forest region. 
             <br>
             Now, if you think acai is delicious with banana and berries, wait till you try it with fish or a nice chicken. 
             <br>
             That's just another example to show how flexible acai can be and how you can put this delicious and highly nutritionous fruit in your diet. And Mmmm...Yummy.
